#Dash

Dash keeps you updated with what's happening.

Dash is the name of the mascot character for the python program, which will allow any developer to create modules (e.g. the episode tracker project ported to work with this project) and hook them into the program. The program will utilize Bottle to create a dashboard on localhost, which can be set as the home page for the end user's browser of choice.

Upon executing the program, the dashboard will open up and provide access to a variety of information retrieved through the modules that the end user opts in to use.

#Future Plans

- User settings page
  - Change name
  - Allow automatic updates at set intervals of time

  - Collect information via forms instead of command prompt
  - Expand compatability to beyond Windows
