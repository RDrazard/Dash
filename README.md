# Dash

Dash keeps you updated with what's happening.

## Upcoming Changes

Dash relies on Python modules which load HTML onto the screen. I plan on moving Dash to Node.js and using JavaScript Web APIs to gather information. Users can opt to highlight particular Facebook pages, Facebook group posts, subreddits, Twitter users, emails etc. They can also choose to sort sources into custom catagories. The interface design will be minimal and will potentially follow material design standards. Rather than opening up various tabs to catch up on what's going on, Dash will bring the information to you.
