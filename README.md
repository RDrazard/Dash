# Dash

Dash keeps you updated with what's happening. Dash is the name of the mascot character for this project, which allows developers to create modules (e.g. the episode tracker project ported to work with this project) and hook them into the program. The program will utilize Bottle to run a dashboard locally on the user's computer, which can be set as the home page for the user's browser of choice.

Upon executing the app, the dashboard will open up and provide access to a variety of information retrieved through the modules that the user opts in to use.

## Upcoming Changes

Dash relies on Python modules which load HTML onto the screen. I plan on moving Dash to Node.js and using JavaScript Web APIs to gather information. Users can opt to highlight particular Facebook pages, Facebook group posts, subreddits, Twitter users, emails etc. They can also choose to sort sources into custom catagories. The interface design will be minimal and will potentially follow material design standards. Rather than opening up various tabs to catch up on what's going on, Dash will bring the information to you.
