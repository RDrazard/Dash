# Dash

Dash highlights the information and news you care about. Rather than opening up various tabs to catch up on what's going on, Dash will bring the information to you. Users will be able to connect various social media sites and opt to highlight specific content (e.g. Facebook pages, Facebook group posts, subreddits, Twitter users, emails, etc.) Users will also have the option to sort sources into custom catagories. The interface design will be minimal and will potentially follow material design standards.

# Setup

1) Download the latest version of [Dash](https://github.com/alanplotko/Dash/archive/master.zip) and extract it to a directory of your choosing. Alternatively, feel free to fork the repo and create a local clone.

2) Install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

3) Now you can cd into the directory that Dash is located in and run `npm install` to set up dependencies.

4) Run the app with `node app.js`.

# Contributing

Dash is in early stages right now and is undergoing development, so there's not much to contribute so far. However, feel free to post suggestions and ideas (i.e. open up an issue and tag it as an enhancement)! When Dash is a tad more mature (or if you're feeling adventurous and impatient), feel free to fork the repo and make a pull request.
